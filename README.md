## Welcome to my new blog

Since I bought my first own PC, I had problems deciding which kind of PC it should be. In recent years, this problem grew even stronger. Thanks to slim keybords and battery packs, completly new kinds of PCs (like so called _convertibles_) appeared and made it much harder to decide, which kind of PC is the most suitable for every situation. In my view, there are about different kinds of PCs:

- Desktops (The well known "big boxes", which are connected to the monitor, they were the first kind of PCs, which was created)
- "Normal" laptops (A sleek combination of screen, computer and keybord with a battery pack, used by all people, who need to travel with their PC)
- Ultrabooks (extremly thin laptops with a very long battery life, constructed for beeing lightweight and independent from an office, but often they are not very powerful)
- Convertibles (Very slim laptops, which can be _converted_ into a tablet in one way or another, therefore the name, some of them could also be considered as ultrabooks)

In my view, the most admirable kind of PC are the high-end ultrabooks: These combine maximum mobility with great computing power. In the following, I will write about the most interesting high-end ultrabooks of our time.

### First Entry (07.10.18): The Razer _Blade_-Series
Have you ever wondered, why this blog is called _blade_? Well, the answer is quite simple: Out there is a great gaming peripherals manufacturer, called _RAZER_. But they offer also a very interesting laptop series, called _Blade_, just as this blog. This series includes an ultrabook, the so called _RAZER Blade Stealth_. And here is the interesting point: There is a second piece of hardware, the _RAZER Core_. With this, you can turn the very lightweight and slim ultrabook into a powerful GAMING MASHINE!!! Therefore, I called my block _blade_. You can find out more about the _RAZER Blade Stealth_ [here](https://www.razer.com/de-de/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-stealth?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ads&utm_content=DE&utm_campaign=EU-stealth-google-remarketing-de&cid=stealth_blade_rem&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvprdob_v3QIViYbtCh3Q4gaTEAEYASAAEgLKEfD_BwE).
